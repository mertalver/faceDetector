# Face Detection Program with OpenCV in Java
This project is a Java-based face detection program that utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in images. <br> 
The program employs the frontalface.xml Haar cascade classifier to achieve accurate face detection. <br>
Additionally, a Java Swing GUI is implemented, offering two main functionalities: <br>
● Capturing faces from a camera feed, <br>
● Detecting faces in a user-selected image file. <br>

## Features
Face detection using OpenCV and frontalface.xml Haar cascade. <br>
In menu you can see two options which they are: <br>
**Take Photo via Camera** : The program captures an image from the camera feed and highlights the detected faces in rectangles. It displays the number of detected faces on the image.
**Upload a Image**: The user can choose an image file, and the program detects faces within it. It highlights the faces in rectangles and displays the total number of detected faces.
