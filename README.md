# Face Detection Program with OpenCV in Java
This project is a Java-based face detection program that utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in images. <br> 
The program employs the frontalface.xml Haar cascade classifier to achieve accurate face detection. <br>
Additionally, a Java Swing GUI is implemented, offering two main functionalities:
● Capturing faces from a camera feed,
● Detecting faces in a user-selected image file.
